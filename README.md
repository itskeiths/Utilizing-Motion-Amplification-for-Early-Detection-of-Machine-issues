# Utilizing-Motion-Amplification-for-Early-Detection-of-Machine-issues

The Machine Fault Detection System is an automated tool developed to detect faults in industrial machines using optical flow analysis and image processing techniques. This system aims to provide early fault detection, enabling proactive maintenance and preventing major breakdowns.

## Features

- Captures videos of machines in operation.
- Applies preprocessing techniques, including bandpass filtering and spatial filtering, to enhance video quality.
- Calculates optical flow to analyze movement patterns.
- Identifies abnormal movement patterns as potential faults.
- Provides real-time fault detection for efficient industrial maintenance.
